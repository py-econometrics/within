## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-12

Initial release of `within`, a high-performance fixed-effects solver for
econometric panel data.

### Added

- **Iterative solvers:** Left-preconditioned CG and right-preconditioned
  GMRES(m) with restarts, stagnation detection, and lucky breakdown handling.
- **Schwarz preconditioners:** Additive (CG-compatible, symmetric) and
  multiplicative (sequential sweep with sparse residual update). Additive
  variant auto-selects between atomic scatter and parallel reduction strategies.
- **Domain decomposition:** Bipartite factor-pair subdomains with connected
  component splitting and partition-of-unity weights.
- **Schur complement reduction:** Exact dense path for small subdomains,
  exact sparse path, and approximate path via GKS clique-tree spectral
  sparsification.
- **Approximate Cholesky local solver** via the `approx-chol` crate, with
  block elimination exploiting bipartite Gramian structure.
- **Dual operator representations:** Explicit CSR Gramian (fused sortless
  assembly from pair blocks) and implicit D^T W D (three-pass, no matrix
  stored).
- **Iterative refinement** with adaptive inner tolerance for observation-space
  accuracy.
- **Batch solve** with Rayon parallelism over RHS vectors, sharing the
  precomputed preconditioner.
- **Persistent `Solver` class** for amortizing preconditioner construction
  across multiple solves.
- **Weighted least squares** support via observation weights.
- **Preconditioner serialization** via `postcard` for Python pickle support.
- **Python API** via PyO3/maturin: `solve()`, `solve_batch()`, `Solver`,
  with full type stubs and GIL release during computation.
- **Zero-copy Python boundary** for F-contiguous category arrays and
  contiguous response vectors.
- **Three Rust crates:** `schwarz-precond` (generic, reusable),
  `within` (FE domain), `within-py` (thin PyO3 bridge).
- Benchmark infrastructure: Criterion micro-benchmarks (Rust) and 18-suite
  Python benchmark framework with setup/solve/accuracy measurement.
- CI/CD: Multi-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows), clippy with
  `-D warnings`, `#![deny(missing_docs)]` on library crates, and
  multi-architecture wheel builds with build attestation.

### Performance

- Adaptive additive Schwarz reduction scheduling with `Auto`, `AtomicScatter`,
  and `ParallelReduction` backends.
- Worker-local reusable reduction buffers for additive parallel reduction.
- Fused Schur right-hand-side assembly and related reduced-system kernel
  cleanup.

### Fixed

- Nested Rayon deadlocks in additive `ParallelReduction` when local solves
  spawn inner parallel work.
